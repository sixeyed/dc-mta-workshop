# Modernizing Monolithic ASP.NET Apps with Docker

Docker runs natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. In this workshop you will learn:

- how to package Windows applications as Docker images and run them as Docker containers
- how to build a Docker image from an MSI and then move away from MSIs
- how to extract features from a monolithic app and run them in containers

Tasks for the workshop are split into sections. 

> Start by making sure your environment is set up correctly

- [Setup](setup.md)

Then we'll follow along with these. 

> It doesn't matter if you're from a dev or an ops background, you'll learn how the Docker platform benefits all aspects of IT.
